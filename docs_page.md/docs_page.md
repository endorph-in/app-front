love it — here’s a clean, demo-ready page layout with three visuals that tell the escrow story at a glance: Stake → Run → Slash/Rewards. i’ve kept it tight, with copy you can paste, image specs for your designer/AI, and consistent style tokens.

Page layout: “How Endorphin Escrow Works”

Hero (top)

Title: How Endorphin Works: Stake → Run → Settle

Subhead: Stake USDC into a timed pool, train with Strava, and let the oracle settle winners who earn the pot.

Small stat strip (optional): Goal: 900 EP · Join: Aug 31–Sep 2 · Live: Sep 3–30 · APR: Fixed via Pendle PT-USDe

Panel 1 — Stake (USDC → PT-USDe, mint sMOL)

Card title: 1) Stake
One-liner: Deposit USDC; the pool buys PT-USDe on Pendle (fixed APR) and mints sMOL as your receipt.
Bullets (max 3):

USDC → USDe → PT-USDe (maturity T ≥ end)

You receive sMOL (non-transferable, per-pool)

sMOL = your pro-rata claim on the pool’s PT-USDe

Image brief (16:9, minimalist vector)

Wallet icon → USDC token → Escrow Pool vault → Pendle logo → PT-USDe coin with a “FIXED APR” badge → back to wallet with sMOL tickets.

Labels on arrows: “swap (slippage-capped)”, “buy PT”.

Accent: a tiny calendar “T” next to PT-USDe to hint maturity.

AI prompt (for image)

Minimal flat illustration, 16:9. Flow: Wallet (USDC) → Escrow Pool → Pendle PT-USDe (fixed APR badge) → Wallet receives sMOL tickets. Use soft purple/aqua palette, clear labels: “USDC”, “PT-USDe”, “sMOL”. Clean backgrounds, no text paragraphs, just icons and 1–2 word labels.

Alt text: “User deposits USDC, pool buys PT-USDe on Pendle, user receives sMOL as receipt.”

Panel 2 — Run (Strava → Flare Oracle → On-chain EP)

Card title: 2) Run
One-liner: Train during the live window; Strava activity is verified by Flare and posted as Effort Points (EP).
Bullets (max 3):

Strava → Flare-signed progress (EP)

User submits EP on-chain (monotonic)

Live leaderboard shows EP & stake

Image brief (16:9, minimalist vector)

Timeline with running/cycling icons across days.

Strava logo → Flare hexagon → blockchain icon → EP bar rising next to a user.

Small badge “Verified” near oracle arrow.

AI prompt (for image)

Minimal flat illustration, 16:9. Timeline with run/cycle icons; Strava logo sends data to a hexagon “Oracle” (Flare), then to a blockchain icon; next to a user avatar, an “EP” progress bar rises. Use same purple/aqua palette, add a small “Verified” stamp.

Alt text: “Strava activity flows through Flare oracle to chain as EP for each user.”

Panel 3 — Slash / Rewards (Settle, winners claim the pot)

Card title: 3) Settle
One-liner: At the end, winners (EP ≥ goal) split the PT-USDe pot; non-finishers are slashed.
Bullets (max 3):

Threshold + Binary Slash (v0)

Winners get pro-rata PT-USDe (UI can auto-swap to USDC)

Losers’ stake → redistributed to winners

Image brief (16:9, minimalist vector)

Leaderboard split into Winners (green pill) and Losers (red pill).

Big pot labeled PT-USDe; arrows to winners’ wallets; a small “slash” icon on losers’ row.

Optional donut: “Winners / Slashed”.

AI prompt (for image)

Minimal flat illustration, 16:9. Leaderboard split: Winners (green) vs Losers (red). Central pot labeled “PT-USDe”. Arrows pay out to winners’ wallets; losers have a small “slash” icon and no payout. Include a small donut showing “Winners / Slashed”. Same purple/aqua palette; clean lines.

Alt text: “After live end, winners receive PT-USDe pro-rata; losers are slashed.”
